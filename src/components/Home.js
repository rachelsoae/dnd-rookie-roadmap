        <p>Dear Novices, Newbies, and Neophytes,</p>
        <p>This site was made with the sole purpose of providing an easy interface for absolute newcomers to Dungeons & Dragons, and D&D-style role-playing games (RPG's), to learn about the game. The content provided is by no means comprehensive, nor is it intended to be. Instead, I wanted to give curious outsiders - much like myself a few years ago - the chance to peek at the big picture without having to scroll through entire blogs or spend money on an official guide. If you like what you find here and want to know more, I highly recommend you check out the Resources page. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy! </p>
        <p>Happy hunting!</p>
        <h3 className='main--emphasis'>Sincerely,</h3>
        <p>Rachel & the Dragons</p>
