        <p>Dear Novices, Newbies, and Neophytes,</p>
        <p>This site was made with the sole purpose of providing an easy interface for absolute newcomers to Dungeons & Dragons, and D&D-style role-playing games (RPG's), to learn about the game. The content provided is by no means comprehensive, nor is it intended to be. Instead, I wanted to give curious outsiders - much like myself a few years ago - the chance to peek at the big picture. If you like what you read here and want to know more, I highly recommend you check out the Resources page. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy. </p>
        <p>Happy hunting!</p>
        <h3>Sincerely,</h3>
        <p>Rachel & the Dragons</p>
